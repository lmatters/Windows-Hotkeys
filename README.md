# Windows-Hotkeys
A collection of Autohotkey scripts for windows.

Autohotkey was used to create varrious, as I deem to be handy, shortcuts and keybindinds.
Some scripts just change the behavior of some basic key functions (ex. Alt_Caps_Lock).

The exe files are what need to be running.
Those whom whould like to see/modify the script used to generate those exe files, see the ahk files.
