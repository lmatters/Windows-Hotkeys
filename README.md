# Windows-Hotkeys
A collection of Autohotkey scripts for windows.

Autohotkey was used to create varrious, as I deem to be handy, shortcuts and keybindinds.
Some scripts just change the behavior of some basic key functions (ex. Alt_Caps_Lock).
Remember the .exe file needs to be running for the functionality to work.
