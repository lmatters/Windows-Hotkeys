# Windows-Hotkeys
A collection of Autohotkey scripts for windows.

Autohotkey was used to create varrious, as I deem to be handy, shortcuts and keybindinds.
Some scripts just change the behavior of some basic key functions (ex. Alt_Caps_Lock).

The exe file is what needs to be running.
Those whom whould like to see/modify the script used to generate those exe files, see the ahk files.

Note: All files here are independant of one another. So you need only download the files you wish.
      Any files that do depend on each other will be kept within a sub folder.
